### Posts

I write [tips]({static}/categories.html#tips-ref) on the frequent small technical challenges I face and solve.

Sometimes, I write longer technical pieces or tutorial-level texts as [articles]({static}/categories.html#articles-ref).

In both cases, I do so because I may look them up someday, and because it may help someone searching the web.
