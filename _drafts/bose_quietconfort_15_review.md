As most IT workers, I work in a open space office with several colleagues.
Its a good office arrangement for many reasons, but it can easily become a loud working environment and make focusing on one's work hard and tiring.
As most workers in big cities, I also spend quite a lot if time in public transport (underground, bus, train), loud environments by definition.

So after thinking about it for a while, I got a headphone with active noise reduction : the Bose QuietConfort 15.


= Why this model

First, I googled for review of headphones with active noise reduction (ARS). I found reviews and comparisons of several products on [les num√©riques](). Their judgment is wihout appeal, the best product for the price is the Bose, second, but more expensive, it the Parrot.

I couldn't yet decide. But I met colleagues of mines who had already purchased one or the other. I quickly tried them on, and was really impressed by the performance of the noise reduction of both. But, all in all, I found the Bose was more comfortable with less pressure on my ears and lighter than the Parrot. As it also was cheaper, my choice was made.

= Active noise reduction in practice

It's funny how impressive the ARS is when you try it for the first time.

Everyone I lended irt to to try it on had the same face, lighted with amazement, children included.

When I got mine, I couldn't help but try the headphone in various conditions. The good point of the Bose Quietconfort is that you don't need to plug it to a device or even listen to music to enable ARS. Just put a battery and use the switch on the right headphone and its running.

So I tried it on the train, in the underground, at home with the kids or people chatting next to me, etc.

Here is how I would describe the efficiency of the ARS (without music playing) :

* regular, background noises such as air conditioning, computer fans, train/underground/car/plane motors are nearly totally erased
* people voice sounds very distant, even when the person is sitting right next to you
    + one can still understand the words and sentences. You won't miss next station announcement on the train unless you're listening to very loud music
* distant crowd noise is very much reduced, it really isn't that much annoying any more. With a little music on, you won't even notice it any more
* striking and violent noises, such as train brakes, car horns, will notably be canceled out but you will still hear them
    + so, using them on the street won't put you totally in danger, but I can not advice to use them on the street, as for any headset it is not very safe to use on the street

Another way of describing the effect : when removing the headphones after using it for a while in the office, it feels like your entering a totally different and very noisy room without even moving from your seat.

= It requires a little time to get used to it

ARS isn't perfect. For physical/acoustical reasons I don't think it can be.

Theoretically, ARS is based on the principle of sound wave cancellation : headset "listens" to the environment and then recreate that sound but with an offset which make the combination of the original sound wave and the generated one a flat signal.

So, in theory, when ARS is on and assuming it works perfectly, no sound wave at all reaches the tympan in your ear.

That's only theory because in practice, some sound waves reach your ear:

* any natural noise is complex, especially environment noise which probably bounced around in the room before reaching you, so reproducing it perfectly and add an offset is very hard
* the microphones and speakers of the noise reduction system aren't perfect and have there own limitations
* I wouldn't be surprised some computation limitation exists in the system
* and that engineers had to less reduce some frequencies for security reasons (voice frequencies or emergency signals maybe)

All those non verified constraints make that your ear ears part of the signal created by the ANR system.

So, during the first few days, I found that using my new headset was tiring. I guess it is the same kind of fatigue you feel when you wear new glasses with a stronger correction.

= Headphone comfort

I really like the Bose Quietconfort 15 headphones as they do not press on my ear at all.

The inside isn't parallel to the surface applied on your skull but leave room for the ear in the back of the headphone removing any risk on pressure. I believe it also directs the speakers toward the entrance of the ear and provides a better sound experience.

= Conclusion

I have been using these headphone at work for almost two weeks and I'm very happy with the quiet environment I now work into.
But I rapidly stopped using it in public transportation. Not that it doesn't work but I don't feel like using them all the time.

I hope the ARS will keep on working that well in the long run.
